# 🚗 AutoVisionNet - Car Image Classification with Transfer Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
AutoVisionNet is a deep learning model for classifying car images using **transfer learning** with **TensorFlow and Keras**. This project fine-tunes a **pretrained CNN model** to recognize and classify different car models efficiently.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Uses **Transfer Learning** with models like ResNet, VGG16, or EfficientNet  
✅ **Data Augmentation** for better generalization  
✅ **Fine-tuning** for optimal performance  
✅ **Train/Test/Validation Split** for evaluation  
✅ Supports **custom dataset** with multiple car categories  

## 📂 Dataset  
This project works with a structured dataset of car images, where images are organized into folders named after car models. The dataset follows this structure:  

```
dataset/
│── train/
│   ├── CarA/
│   ├── CarB/
│   ├── CarC/
│── val/
│   ├── CarA/
│   ├── CarB/
│   ├── CarC/
│── test/
│   ├── CarA/
│   ├── CarB/
│   ├── CarC/
```

## 🛠️ Model Architecture  
This project leverages **transfer learning** with models such as:  
- **VGG16**  
- **ResNet50**  
- **EfficientNetB0**  
- **MobileNetV2**  

The model consists of:  
✅ Pretrained **CNN Backbone**  
✅ **Fully Connected Layers** for classification  
✅ **Dropout & Batch Normalization** for better generalization  

## 📊 Results & Performance  
| Model | Accuracy | Training Time |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| VGG16 | 89% | 10 min |
| ResNet50 | 92% | 15 min |
| EfficientNetB0 | 94% | 12 min |
